# Hi Readers !
### I am UDATHA HARINATH . I am a 2nd year Btech Student from VITAP University (Amaravati) . I am an Undergraduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering with specialization in VLSI. However with a great interest in VLSI , i am spending my most of the interest on learning and doing projects using Open Source tools Cadence Virtuoso , Xschem etc . I wish this repository will give you a practical and Signifiacnt Knowledge on Designing and Analysis on characterstics of CMOS Inverter. In this Project ,I am using some Open source tools like Xschem SKY130 , Ngspice , MagicVlsi etc.,
